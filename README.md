# BruhBot
### This bot is in development. Documentation will be added here once the project reaches a point where it is stable and practical for use on the Bruh Chat Discord. Once that has been achieved, you can help improve it by making pull requests for README.md.

## To-do list:
- Punishment system (kick, ban, etc.) and hall of fame
- help command
- fun stuff like polls and games
