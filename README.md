### Basic info

BruhBot's prefix is `b/`, meaning that if you send a message starting with `b/`, it will interpret it as a command or attempt at one. 

If you ever need a quick refresher on BruhBot and its commands, you can always use `b/help` or `b/h`. You can also add a command after that to get more info on it. For example, if I send `b/h help`, it will give me more info on the help command. 

BruhBot now replies using embeds rather than plain text messages. This means that content it sends will be fancier and richer. It also means that it will be able to show more information within a shorter delay and smaller area on your Discord client. 

Moderation is already handled by UnbelievaBruh, so any such command on BruhBot (i.e. `b/ban`) is purely cosmetic and for meme purposes only.
